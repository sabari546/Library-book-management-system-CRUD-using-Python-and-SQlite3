# Library Book Management System

This project is aimed at developing a Library Book Management System with a front-end GUI developed using Tkinter and a backend database implemented in SQLite. The system is designed to facilitate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a 'books' database. It provides a single-window Tkinter GUI application for managing library books effectively.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface:** Utilizes Tkinter for an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **SQLite Database:** Backend database management for storing and retrieving book records.
- **CRUD Operations:** Allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete book records.
- **Search Functionality:** Enables users to search for books based on various criteria such as title, author, year of publication, or ISBN.
- **Display Records:** Presents matching records in a large text area or list box for easy viewing.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter
- **Database:** SQLite

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (Tkinter and SQLite).
3. Run the Python script for the Library Book Management System.
4. Use the GUI interface to perform CRUD operations on the book database.
5. Enter book details when prompted for creating or updating records.
6. Search for books using the search functionality.
7. View matching records displayed in the designated area.

## Future Improvements

- **User Authentication:** Implement user login functionality for secure access to the system.
- **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling to provide informative messages to users.
- **Advanced Search Options:** Add advanced search options such as filtering by genre, availability, etc.
- **Data Validation:** Implement data validation to ensure the integrity of book records.
